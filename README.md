Hints

The exploration should have a goal. As you explore the data, keep in mind that you want to answer which type of shows to produce and how to grow the business.
Ensure each recommendation is backed by data. The company is looking for data-driven insights, not personal opinions or anecdotes.
Assume that you are presenting your findings to business executives who have only a basic understanding of data science. Avoid unnecessary technical jargon.
Start by exploring a few questions: What type of content is available in different countries?

## Introduction
The Data Exploration and Visualization project focuses on analyzing and visualizing data to gain insights and tell compelling stories using data-driven approaches. This repository contains notebooks and code for exploring various datasets, cleaning the data, and creating meaningful visualizations.

## Objective
The primary objectives of this project are:
- Explore diverse datasets to understand the data's structure and characteristics.
- Conduct data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data quality and usability.
- Utilize data visualization techniques to present findings and insights effectively.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand data distribution and patterns.
- Data cleaning techniques to handle missing values and outliers.
- Creating informative visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Plotly (optional)

*(Feel free to add or modify the list of technologies based on the tools and libraries used in your project)*

## Installation
To run the Data Exploration and Visualization notebooks locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/raghav1saboo/Data-Exploration-and-Visualization.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd Data-Exploration-and-Visualization
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies using the following command:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Open Jupyter Notebook to access the data exploration notebooks:
   ```
   jupyter notebook
   ```

2. In the Jupyter Notebook interface, navigate to the "notebooks" directory, and open the desired notebook.

3. Run the code cells in the notebook to perform data exploration, visualization, and analysis.
